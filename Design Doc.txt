Planet Destroyers


- 2D mobile "infinite runner" arcade game
- Planet Defense game with coin collection, power ups, characters and upgrades
- Uniqueness points
	instead of shooting planets with bullets, YOU ARE THE BULLET. 
	use orbits to manuver around the map
	

Basic Gameplay 
- home planet in middle of screen, constantly rotating
- hostile objects spawn in all corners of the screen and fly towards the middle, destroy them by blasting off
	different sized planets, asteroids, medium planets, big planets. bigger ones need cracking. 
	planets with rotating moons -> have to destroy moon first. if destroy planet first the moon will fly off 
	space debris: can only be destroyed by hitting a weak point. otherwise bounces player away
	spinng planets: has a ring, you must land on it right or you will get smacked away
	blackholes? randomly spinning planets? flying ufo enemies? 
	UFOs that charge forward a big chunk of space at a time. -> gets destroyed by pushing planets
	ironclad planets that can only be destroyed via chainedExplosions
- player actions
	jump to blast off planets. 
	special action: homing beacon: instantly stop all movement and fly slowly back to the home planet, until landing on it or another planet
- pick ups
	planets drop coins upon explosion that you can pick up
		big treasure planets drop big coins that cannot be attracted but they are bigger so you can just run into it
	special planets drop power ups upon blowing up
		extra speed, more mass (faster attraction), double coins, etc
- Orbital slings
	aim slightly off a big planet to use the planet's gravity to change your flight course
- character classes/special powerups
	default skill is the homing beacon
	use powerups to get new skills 
		dash forward
		hookshot
		enlarge
		teleport
- upgrades
	player
		charge upgrade 
		flying max speed
		combo decay speed
	planet
		rotation speed
		health
		blast off speed

Random ideas
- planet pushing
	- if the planet doesn't blow up, taking off will push them a bit in the direction opposite of take off
		charge your jump to do extra pushes
	- use this to make planets hit each other. planets that hit each other will
		A: become coupled and will travel together as a group. if one blows up they will all blow up. use this to get combos and get extra points
		B: damage each other 
- action button
	has charges that you can replenish by blowing up planets
- combos
	- blow up planets in quick successtion for extra points
	- maybe every 3 seconds. can be upgraded to last loner
- adaptive soundtrack
	more planets on screen = more instruments on the sound track
- progression
	instead of simple level scalling, maybe have some sort of progression system?
	planet travels to new galaxy and every current planet gets a reskin
	OR planet travels to new galaxy and 1 new element is introduced
	figure out when this ends
- dynamic dificulty
	make game harder/easier based on how player is doing/how many enemies on screen
	check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain

- story mode divided into worlds like downwell and burrito bull
	set amount of worlds you go through. and there is an ending. but you can play the game skillfully and use that to get more points. 
- should the upgrade system be like downwell too? after beating each stage you choose to buy an upgrade	
	or like burrito bull? you finish each stage, use the money to buy things and then try again?

TODO
- planet coupling
	simulate outline effect by rendering another sprite under it
- planet combos
- better difficulty curve
- better spawning
	planets should spawn somewhere far from current planets
- respawn stuff and initial positions
-Refactor
	code for switching planets when you just hit them vs code for landonplanet
	Cloning new player obj for warping and notifying all objs (such as gameManager and playerHUD of a new player)
		also cleaner way of copying data from one player to the next
	Detecting when a player has respawned vs. warped for the sake of resetting player state
		use an event system to notify all objs that care about players to switch pointers
		also create a more elegant way of retiring old players so they don't show up anymore
	planets could be refactored with polymorphism

- upgrade to new unity?

		
BUGS
- when planet is flying towards you and you jump on it you get crushed between it and the home planet
- camera stuck on shaking even when game is over (because everything is based on deltaTime, maybe put camera on real time)
		
		
ORBITS
- goal: home planet should absolute attract within a certain zone, and 
- gravity formula of 2.5 power and home planet mass of 18 seems too much.
