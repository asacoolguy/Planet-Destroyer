Planet Destroyers


- 2D mobile "infinite runner" arcade game
- Planet Defense game with coin collection, power ups, characters and upgrades
- Uniqueness points
	instead of shooting planets with bullets, YOU ARE THE BULLET. 
	use orbits to manuver around the map
	

Basic Gameplay 
- home planet in middle of screen, constantly rotating
- hostile objects spawn in all corners of the screen and fly towards the middle, destroy them by blasting off
	different sized planets, asteroids, medium planets, big planets. bigger ones need cracking. 
	treasure planets: blowing up releases powerups and extra money
	planets with rotating moons -> have to destroy moon first. if destroy planet first the moon will fly off 
	space debris: can only be destroyed by hitting a weak point. otherwise bounces player away
	spinng planets: has a ring, you must land on it right or you will get smacked away
	blackholes that sucks you in (magnetically not orbitally) and kills you if you hit the middle. 
		push a planet into it to make it go away.
	UFOs that charge forward a big chunk of space at a time. -> gets destroyed by pushing planets
	ironclad planets that can only be destroyed via planet pushing.
	poison planets that will kill you if landed on. can only be destroyed via planet pushing
- player actions
	jump to blast off planets. 
	special action: homing beacon: instantly stop all movement and fly slowly back to the home planet, until landing on it or another planet
- pick ups
	planets drop coins upon explosion that you can pick up
		big treasure planets drop big coins that cannot be attracted but they are bigger so you can just run into it
	special planets drop power ups upon blowing up
		extra speed, more mass (faster attraction), double coins, etc
- Orbital slings
	aim slightly off a big planet to use the planet's gravity to change your flight course
- character classes/special powerups
	default skill is the homing beacon
	use powerups to get new skills 
		dash forward
		hookshot
		enlarge
		teleport
- upgrades
	player
		charge time
		special skill cooldown
		coin magnet radius
		blast off speed
		crack dmg
		planet push power
	planet
		rotation speed -> increase rotation speed of all planets you land on
	progression
		fast forward through different chapter 
		

Random ideas
- action button
	has charges that you can replenish by blowing up planets
- combos
	- blow up planets in a set amount of time to rack up combos for extra points
	- blowing up a planet by pushing it into another planet gives extra points
	- landing on earth clears the combo
- better warping -> like in towerfall
	dumplicate planets when they warp
- adaptive soundtrack
	more planets on screen = more instruments on the sound track
- progression
	instead of simple level scalling, maybe have some sort of progression system?
	planet travels to new galaxy and every current planet gets a reskin
	OR planet travels to new galaxy and 1 new element is introduced
	figure out when this ends
- dynamic dificulty
	make game harder/easier based on how player is doing/how many enemies on screen
	check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
	https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130188/gameplay_design_fundamentals_.php?page=5
- story mode divided into worlds like downwell and burrito bison
	set amount of worlds you go through. and there is an ending. but you can play the game skillfully and use that to get more points. 
- should the upgrade system be like downwell too? after beating each stage you choose to buy an upgrade	
	or like burrito bull? you finish each stage, use the money to buy things and then try again?
- coins
	should they be more like downwell's coins: small, light/bouncy, interacts with physics

TODO



REFACTOR
	code for switching planets when you just hit them vs code for landonplanet
	Cloning new player obj for warping and notifying all objs (such as gameManager and playerHUD of a new player)
		also cleaner way of copying data from one player to the next
	Detecting when a player has respawned vs. warped for the sake of resetting player state
		use an event system to notify all objs that care about players to switch pointers
		also create a more elegant way of retiring old players so they don't show up anymore
	planets could be refactored with polymorphism?
	gameManager singleton vs static class
	mapManager should start the game when its loaded or just contain info and let gameManager start the game when loaded?
	GameManager's load scene methods are being called in wrapper functions across multiple classes. is there a way to consolidate this?
		move the onclick methods set up of buttons to GameManager
	Think of better way to pause the game (like with a gamePaused boolean) instead of just setting timescale to 0
	Better way of setting the maxValue of an upgrade item. right now you have to do it in code AND in the scene. should just be 1 place.
	Difficulty curve needs to be redone completely.
	Homeplanet's rotation speed shouldn't be set by player as it is right now b/c of the upgrade system

- upgrade to new unity?

		
BUGS
- when planet is flying towards you and you jump on it you get crushed between it and the home planet
- camera stuck on shaking even when game is over (because everything is based on deltaTime, maybe put camera on real time)
- if big planets hits a small planet that explodes, the big planet keeps going and overlaps the small planet 
	stop movement of this planet or bounce it off upon collision
- detecting planet landing messes up when a bunch of planets are bundled up together
- sometimes pressing the launch button damages the planet but you don't actually take off
- sometimes coins would circle you without actually being picked up
- blowing up planets near corners and then immediately warping will cause coins chasing you to lose target due to being warped to the wrong side.
	solution: coins spawned from leaving planets do not warp and are children of the player object. so when player gets cloned during warping they get cloned too.
		their speed scales to the player's speed so they always get collected after set amount of seconds
		note once they get duplicated, the old coins should no longer be colletable by the old player, though they should still continue being attracted
		consider making the coins released by planets during collision have rigidbodies to differ from these chasing coins which don't
		after fixing this make the player's starting coin attraction radius small again
- planet collision detection based on speed isn't perfect. sometimes when two planets are close to each other and then one is pushed, the collision detection doesn't happen. 
	try spawning one planet super close to another and see what happens
- planets spawn too close to each other
	solution 1: make a spwan checker to be spawned first. it's just a circle collider to check if the area is clear. if it is, spawn the next frame.
				if it isn't pick a new spot to spawn. if this doesnt work 3 times in a row. wait X seconds.
- trail renderer goes away after some orbit slings
- quitting using the pause menu during the game still makes the GameOver coroutine run
- player not always landing on planet even when it obvious ht it. same with coin attraction
		
ORBITS
- goal: home planet should absolute attract within a certain zone, and 
- gravity formula of 2.5 power and home planet mass of 18 seems too much.

Alpha Feedback
- do we even need a jump button? maybe you can just press anywhere on the screen. show "charging" with animation
- should launch speed be upgradable? maybe that should always be the same so the player get used to it. make other things upgradable.
